# üå¶Ô∏è An AI-Powered Weather App

Hey there! This is a weather forecast app I built to be a little more fun and helpful than the average one. It doesn't just give you the temperature‚Äîit uses Google's AI to give you creative and practical advice based on the day's weather.

I wanted to create something that was both useful and cool to look at. The app has a clean, modern design with a fun little intro animation. It pulls live weather data for any city you search for, showing you the forecast, humidity, and wind speed. But the best part is the "AI Suggestions" button, which gives you ideas for what to wear and what you could do that day!

### ## ‚ú® What It's Made With

This project is built with the classic web trio: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

* For the slick design, I used **Tailwind CSS**.
* The live weather data comes from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
* The creative advice is generated by the **Google Gemini API**.

### ## üöÄ How to Run It on Your Computer

Getting this up and running is pretty simple. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

1.  **Download the Code**
    * Click the green "Code" button on this GitHub page and choose "Download ZIP".
    * Unzip the folder on your computer.

2.  **Get Your Secret Keys**
    * You'll need two free API keys to make the app work:
        * One from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (for the weather).
        * One from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) (for the AI suggestions).

3.  **Add Your Keys**
    * Open the project folder in a code editor like VS Code.
    * In the `script.js` file, you'll see these lines at the very top. Just paste your keys here:
    ```javascript
    const OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "Your-OpenWeather-Key-Goes-Here";
    const GEMINI_API_KEY = "Your-Gemini-Key-Goes-Here";
    ```

4.  **Launch the App!**
    * If you're using VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension.
    * Right-click on the `index.html` file and choose "Open with Live Server".
    * That's it! The app should open up in your browser.

Feel free to play around with the code and make it your own!
